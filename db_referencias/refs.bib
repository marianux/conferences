  Abstract                 = {An analysis of electrocardiographic pattern recognition parameters for premature ventricular contraction (PVC) and normal (N) beat classification is presented. Twenty-six parameters were defined: 11 ?? 2 for the two electrocardiogram (ECG) leads, width of the complex and three parameters derived from a single-plane vectorcardiogram ({VCG}). Some of the parameters include amplitudes of maximal positive and maximal negative peaks, area of absolute values, area of positive values, area of negative values, number of samples with 70% higher amplitude than that of the highest peak, amplitude and angle of the QRS vector in a {VCG} plane. They were measured for all heartbeats annotated as N or PVC in all 48 ECG recordings of the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. Two reference sets for the K th nearest-neighbours rule were used???global and local. The classification indices obtained with the global reference set were 75.4% specificity and 80.9% sensitivity. Using the local reference set we increased the specificity to 96.7% and the sensitivity to 96.9%. The achieved specificity and sensitivity are comparable with, and greater than, the results reported in the literature.},

  Abstract                 = {The current state-of-the-art in automatic QRS detection methods show high robustness and almost negligible error rates. In return, the methods are usually based on machine-learning approaches that require sufficient computational resources. However, simple-fast methods can also achieve high detection rates. There is a need to develop numerically efficient algorithms to accommodate the new trend towards battery-driven ECG devices and to analyze long-term recorded signals in a time-efficient manner. A typical QRS detection method has been reduced to a basic approach consisting of two moving averages that are calibrated by a knowledge base using only two parameters. In contrast to high-accuracy methods, the proposed method can be easily implemented in a digital filter design.},

  Abstract                 = {Cardiovascular diseases are the number one cause of death worldwide. Currently, portable battery-operated systems such as mobile phones with wireless ECG sensors have the potential to be used in continuous cardiac function assessment that can be easily integrated into daily life. These portable point-of-care diagnostic systems can therefore help unveil and treat cardiovascular diseases. The basis for ECG analysis is a robust detection of the prominent QRS complex, as well as other ECG signal characteristics. However, it is not clear from the literature which ECG analysis algorithms are suited for an implementation on a mobile device. We investigate current QRS detection algorithms based on three assessment criteria: 1) robustness to noise, 2) parameter choice, and 3) numerical efficiency, in order to target a universal fast-robust detector. Furthermore, existing QRS detection algorithms may provide an acceptable solution only on small segments of ECG signals, within a certain amplitude range, or amid particular types of arrhythmia and/or noise. These issues are discussed in the context of a comparison with the most conventional algorithms, followed by future recommendations for developing reliable QRS detection schemes suitable for implementation on battery-operated mobile devices.},

  Abstract                 = {We have investigated the quantitative effects of a number of common elements of QRS detection rules using the MIT/BIH arrhythmia database. A previously developed linear and nonlinear filtering scheme was used to provide input to the QRS detector decision section. We used the filtering to preprocess the database. This yielded a set of event vectors produced from QRS complexes and noise. After this preprocessing, we tested different decision rules on the event vectors. This step was carried out at processing speeds up to 100 times faster than real time. The role of the decision rule section is to discriminate the QRS events from the noise events. We started by optimizing a simple decision rule. Then we developed a progressively more complex decision process for QRS detection by adding new detection rules. We implemented and tested a final real-time QRS detection algorithm, using the optimized decision rule process. The resulting QRS detection algorithm has a sensitivity of 99.69 percent and positive predictivity of 99.77 percent when evaluated with the MIT/BIH arrhythmia database.},

  Abstract                 = {In this study, the upward I(US) and downward I(DS) slopes of the QRS complex are proposed as indices for quantifying ischemia-induced electrocardiogram (ECG) changes. Using ECG recordings acquired before and during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), it is found that the QRS slopes are considerably less steep during artery occlusion, in particular for I(DS). With respect to ischemia detection, the slope indices outperform the often used high-frequency index (defined as the root mean square (rms) of the bandpass-filtered QRS signal for the frequency band 150-250 Hz) as the mean relative factors of change are much larger for I(US) and I(DS) than for the high-frequency index (6.9 and 7.3 versus 3.7). The superior performance of the slope indices is equally valid when other frequency bands of the high-frequency index are investigated (the optimum one is found to be 125-175 Hz). Employing a simulation model in which the slopes of a template QRS are altered by different techniques, it is found that the slope changes observed during PTCA are mostly due to a widening of the QRS complex or a decrease of its amplitudes, but not a reduction of its high-frequency content or a combination of this and the previous effects. It is concluded that QRS slope information can be used as an adjunct to the conventional ST segment analysis in the monitoring of myocardial ischemia.},

The proposed method uses a modified version of a previously presented measure of periodicity and a phase-wrapping of the RR-interval, for extracting the "most periodic" linear mixtures of a recorded dataset. It is shown that the method is an improved extension of conventional source separation techniques, specifically customized for ECG signals. The method is therefore of special interest for the decomposition and compression of multichannel ECG, and for the removal of maternal ECG artifacts from fetal ECG recordings.},

  Abstract                 = {High-frequency mid-QRS (HFQRS) analysis was recently introduced as a tool for identification of stress-induced ischemia. The diagnostic performance of this electrocardiographic technique has not been determined in a large cohort of patients. This study compared the diagnostic performance of HFQRS analysis to conventional ST-segment analysis in detecting exercise-induced ischemia. The study included 996 patients (56 ± 10 years of age, 670 men) referred for exercise myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI), which served as the gold standard of ischemia. High-resolution electrocardiogram was used for computer analysis of HFQRS signals. Number of electrocardiographic leads with ?50\% decrease of HFQRS intensity (L(50\%)) was used as an index of ischemia. Perfusion images were evaluated semiquantitatively. Receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated an L(50\%) ?3 as the criterion that yielded optimal sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing moderate/severe ischemia. Compared to ST-segment analysis HFQRS analysis was more sensitive (69\% vs 39\%, p <0.005) and more specific (86\% vs 82\%, p <0.05). L(50\%) correlated with amount of MPI ischemia (R(2) = 0.75, p <0.0001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated a significant incremental diagnostic value for the addition of HFQRS data to a model containing pretest and conventional exercise parameters. L(50\%) was the best predictor of mild or moderate/severe MPI ischemia. In conclusion, computerized HFQRS analysis improved the diagnostic performance of conventional stress electrocardiogram in detecting exercise-induced ischemia. Thus, this technique might aid in the noninvasive evaluation of coronary artery disease.},

  Abstract                 = {A new, patient-adaptive {ECG} patient monitoring algorithm is described. The algorithm combines a patient-independent neural network classifier with a three-parameter patient model. The patient model is used to modulate the patient-independent classifier via multiplicative connections. Adaptation is carried out by gradient descent in the patient model parameter space. The patient-adaptive classifier was compared with a well-established baseline algorithm on six major databases, consisting of over 3 million heartbeats. When trained on an initial 77 records and tested on an additional 382 records, the patient-adaptive algorithm was found to reduce the number of Vn errors on one channel by a factor of 5, and the number of Nv errors by a factor of 10. We conclude that patient adaptation provides a significant advance in classifying normal vs. ventricular beats for {ECG} patient monitoring},
