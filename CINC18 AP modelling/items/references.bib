  abstract = {Abstract Melatonin reduces reperfusion arrhythmias when administered before coronary occlusion, but in the clinical context of acute coronary syndromes, most of the therapies are administered at the time of reperfusion. Patients frequently have physiological modifications that can reduce the response to therapeutic interventions. This work determined whether acute melatonin administration starting at the moment of reperfusion protects against ventricular arrhythmias in Langendorff?perfused hearts isolated from fructose?fed rats (FFR), a dietary model of metabolic syndrome, and from spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR). In both experimental models, we confirmed metabolic alterations, a reduction in myocardial total antioxidant capacity and an increase in arterial pressure and NADPH oxidase activity, and in FFR, we also found a decrease in eNOS activity. Melatonin (50�?m) initiated at reperfusion after 15?min regional ischemia reduced the incidence of ventricular fibrillation from 83\% to 33\% for the WKY strain, from 92\% to 25\% in FFR, and from 100\% to 33\% in SHR (P�=�0.0361, P�=�0.0028, P�=�0.0013, respectively, by Fisher's exact test, n�=�12 each). Although, ventricular tachycardia incidence was high at the beginning of reperfusion, the severity of the arrhythmias progressively declined in melatonin?treated hearts. Melatonin induced a shortening of the action potential duration at the beginning of reperfusion and in the SHR group also a faster recovery of action potential amplitude. We conclude that melatonin protects against ventricular fibrillation when administered at reperfusion, and these effects are maintained in hearts from rats exposed to major cardiovascular risk factors. These results further support the ongoing translation to clinical trials of this agent.},

  abstract = {Cardiovascular diseases are the major cause of mortality in patients on hemodialysis (HD). Recently, signal averaged electrocardiography (SAECG) has been developed to detect ventricular late potentials (LP) noninvasively from the body surface for identifying patients at sudden death or ventricular tachycardia. We performed SAECG in 42 patients before and after HD. As a result, postdialysis total filtered QRS duration (FQRS) was significantly increased compared with predialysis FQRS. Postdialysis duration of low amplitude signal under 40 microV in the latter part of QRS (LAS40) tended to increase compared with predialysis LAS40. Before HD, there were no patients with LP and only one patient (2.4{\%}) with abnormal SAECGs. In contrast, after HD, there were three patients (7.1{\%}) with LP and three more patients (7.1{\%}) with abnormal SAECGs. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between the changes in LAS40 (delta LAS40) and those in potassium (K) (delta K) during HD. We further examined the relation between LAS40 and the concentration of K, by comparing the correlation coefficient between patients in the high-K group (predialysis K {\textgreater} or = 5.0 mEq/L; 20 patients) and those in the low-K group (predialysis K {\textless} 5.0 mEq/L; 22 patients). In the low-K group, there was no significant correlation between delta LAS40 and delta K. However, in the high-K group, there was a significant correlation between delta LAS40 and delta K. In conclusion, SAECG indices worsened during HD, and an insufficient decrement of serum potassium by HD is suggested to have been an arrhythmogenic factor in the high-K group.},
